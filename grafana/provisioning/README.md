# Provisioning

Grafana configuration objects such as data sources & dashboards can be stored
in yml format in this directory and will be picked up by the grafana container
specified in the docker-compose file in the root of this project. 

Official documentation on provisioning can be found [here](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/provisioning/).
